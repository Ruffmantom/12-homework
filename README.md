# 12-homework
This app is an employee tracker. It takes in a input from the console and creates a database for the manager or company owner.

This program took a really long time with different pieces of the puzzle. took at least 3 hours on trying to figure out how to display the roles as choices for Inquirer then to get the id of that choice and correspond it with the role id inside of the table of Employee. This was actually a really fun project but you can get so burned out if you dot know what to search. Which was me for a while with this project. I like working with Database stuff and think its fun to figure out how to work with it.
Below is a video on youtube for how it works.
